## 📝 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to strengthen my Power BI skills by building an interactive dashboard, analyzing sales and profit data, uncovering insights, and providing actionable recommendations to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze sales, profit, and quantity trends across markets and categories
* Identify high-performing and underperforming regions and product categories
* Understand top customers and their contributions to revenue
* Detect temporal patterns and sales peaks
* Apply Power BI skills including data modeling, DAX, and dashboard storytelling

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Power BI
* Power Query
* DAX
* Microsoft Excel (dataset source)

## 🔄 Data Preparation & Modeling

* Imported the dataset into Power BI (Get Data)
* Transformed the data using Power Query
* Extracted Month & Week from Order Date column
* Performed minimal data cleaning (dataset was already well-structured)
* Modeled the data and created a calculated column for Profit
* Built DAX measures: Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity Sold, Average Sales, Profit Margin, Sales Growth
* Designed interactive visuals to communicate insights effectively

## 📐 Key Metrics

| Metric                    | Value    |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| Total Sales               | $2.04M   |
| Total Profit              | $775.61K |
| Profit Margin             | 37.98%   |
| Average Sales/Transaction | $40.84K  |
| Total Quantity Sold       | 50       |

## 🔍 Key Insights

* **Top Market:** Lagos leads in both sales and profit; Abuja shows high profit relative to sales; Rivers underperforms
* **Category Performance:** Electronics drive profit despite lower sales; Furniture has high sales but low profit
* **Sales Trends:** Peaks on Jan 20, 24, 28, and Feb 4 likely due to promotions or seasonal demand
* **Customer Insights:** Top 5 customers contribute ~24% of revenue; Customer 40 leads with ~$110K

## ✅ Recommendations

* **Focus on high-performing markets:** Prioritize Lagos and Abuja for strategic marketing and inventory planning
* **Address underperforming regions:** Investigate Rivers to understand low performance and implement corrective actions
* **Optimize category strategy:** Leverage Electronics for profit growth; review Furniture pricing, costs, or discount strategies to improve margins
* **Plan for seasonal peaks:** Prepare inventory, promotions, and campaigns around identified peak sales dates (Jan 20, 24, 28, Feb 4)
* **Engage top customers:** Maintain strong relationships with top 5 customers, especially Customer 40, who contributes significantly to revenue
* **Monitor emerging trends:** Continuously analyze data to identify shifts in customer behavior or market performance for proactive decision-making

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

This project strengthened my skills in:

* Power Query transformations
* Data modeling
* DAX calculations and measures
* Dashboard design and storytelling
* Turning data into actionable business insights

It also reinforced the importance of **consistency, learning, and incremental growth** in building data analytics expertise.
